  <h1>Species Spotlight: Northern Pine Snake</h1>
  <p><em>Pituophis melanoleucus melanoleucus</em></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Northern Pine Snake is a bold, burrowing colubrid native to the eastern United States. Known for its striking pattern, deep hissing, and confident demeanour, it’s a favourite among keepers who love a bit of drama in their snake room.</p>

  <h2>Subspecies & Range</h2>
  <p>The Pine Snake is part of a broader species complex, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Northern Pine Snake</strong> – <em>Pituophis melanoleucus melanoleucus</em> – Eastern U.S.</li>
    <li><strong>Florida Pine Snake</strong> – <em>P. m. mugitus</em> – Florida & southern Georgia</li>
    <li><strong>Black Pine Snake</strong> – <em>P. m. lodingi</em> – Alabama & Mississippi (protected)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Appearance</h2>
  <p>These snakes can reach 5–7 feet in length. Northern subspecies often show bold black saddles on a pale ground colour, with a powerful head and keeled scales that give a rugged texture.</p>

  <h2>Behaviour</h2>
  <p>Not shy! Pine snakes are active, intelligent, and highly inquisitive. When threatened, they may flatten their head, vibrate their tail, and emit a loud, guttural hiss through their glottis. But in captivity, with regular handling, most settle into calm and curious pets.</p>

  <h2>Captive Care</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enclosure:</strong> 4–6ft minimum. Provide depth for burrowing and climbing enrichment.</li>
    <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> Aspen, soil mix, or cypress mulch – needs to support digging.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Warm end around 30°C (86°F), cool end around 22°C (72°F).</li>
    <li><strong>Feeding:</strong> Typically large rodents. Great feeders, but avoid obesity.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperament:</strong> Often vocal, rarely aggressive. Very intelligent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why We Love Them</h2>
  <p>Pine snakes are underrated. They’re hardy, engaging, and full of personality. Their confidence makes them a great display animal – and their look is like no other. If you want a colubrid with a bit of flair, this is it.</p>
